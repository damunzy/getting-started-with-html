  Hello <b>World</b>!
</br>^- I didn't like the non-programmy into line that Andy had us do so I went with the standard intro to programming line.

<h1>NOTES:</h1>
Thinking like a programmer:
<h2>1. Procedural Thinking</h2>
Breaking a problem into steps.
<h2>2. Abstract Thinking</h2>
It's abstract and it's thinking.
<h2>3. Systems Thinking</h2>
Seems to be a lot like Step 1. Procedural Thinking
<h2>4. Technological Thinking (Technological Empathy)</h2>
Understanding what is going on "under the hood" with technology.
<h2>5. Debugging (Systematic Debugging)</h2>
ID the problem(s) and track down the cause(s).
<h2>Blah, blah, blah Andy's story</h2>
Just kidding, I agree with the "Just about anyone can learn just about anything". I'll be applying to Udacity soon too. ;)
<h1>Comments to course designer:</h1>
<h2>Require signing up for account at Codepen</h2>
The reason for this will be addressed in comment #2.
<h2>Submit projects through Codepen</h2>
The reason for comment #1! I think this is a much cleaner way to submit projects than a zip file.
<h2>Ignore the horrible formatting</h2>
I only know a little bit about HTML and CSS.
